# Ecosystem: Beyond Sticky Notes and YAML - Crafting Great APIs with DDD and AI

## Abstract

Most APIs are little more than technical receipts — endpoints listed, payloads defined, done.
But what if your APIs could be living expressions of your business domain, where every resource, event, and boundary tells a story that both developers and domain experts can read?

This talk reveals how Domain-Driven Design meets modern API craftsmanship to transform how we build systems.
You'll discover how collaborative techniques like **Domain Storytelling**, **Event Storming**, and **Context Mapping** don't just inform your design — they become your OpenAPI and AsyncAPI specifications, capturing domain intent rather than just data shapes.

Here's the twist: LLMs aren't here to replace your thinking. They're here to amplify it. See how AI can translate visual domain models into executable API contracts while keeping the human insight and nuance that machines can't fake. It's craftsmanship enhanced, not eliminated.

Through real-world examples, you'll see:
•	How bounded contexts become API boundaries you can defend
•	How ubiquitous language stops translation bugs before they start
•	How contract-first design makes change safe, not scary

Walk away seeing APIs differently: not as integration tax, but as domain boundaries that align your architecture, business strategy, and team understanding in one elegant stroke.
