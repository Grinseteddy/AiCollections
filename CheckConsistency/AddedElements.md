# Consistency Analysis: Visual Glossary vs OpenAPI Specification

## Entities Present in Both
1. Inbox
2. Task
3. Note
4. Attachment
5. Document
6. File
7. Team member
8. Clerk
9. Status (for Task)

## Relationships and Attributes Consistency

### Inbox
- Visual Glossary: Contains 0..* Tasks
- OpenAPI: Consistent (InboxList contains array of Tasks)

### Task
- Visual Glossary: 
  - Contains 1 Status, 1 Description, 0..1 Assignee, 1 Creator, 0..n Notes, 0..n Attachments, 1 Identifier, 1 last update
- OpenAPI: 
  - Mostly consistent
  - Additional fields in OpenAPI: createdAt, timeBooked (array of numbers)

### Note
- Visual Glossary: Contains Text, Author, createdAt
- OpenAPI: Consistent

### Attachment
- Visual Glossary: References to 1 Document
- OpenAPI: Consistent, includes filename

### Document
- Visual Glossary: Contains 0..* Files
- OpenAPI: Consistent

### File
- Visual Glossary: Part of Document management
- OpenAPI: Consistent

### Team member
- Visual Glossary: Referenced by Assignee and Note Author
- OpenAPI: Consistent

### Clerk
- Visual Glossary: Referenced by Task Creator
- OpenAPI: Consistent

### Status (for Task)
- Visual Glossary: new, In Progress, Done, declined, not assigned
- OpenAPI: Consistent, except "In Progress" is "inProgress" and "not assigned" is not explicitly listed (might be implied by null assignee)

## Inconsistencies and Missing Elements

1. **TimeBooked**: Present in OpenAPI Task schema, but not in the visual glossary.

2. **Status "not assigned"**: Visual glossary shows this as a separate status, while in OpenAPI it might be implied by a null assignee.

3. **Inbox details**: The visual glossary shows multiple Inbox entities, but the OpenAPI doesn't provide details on different types of inboxes.

4. **Task Identifier**: Explicitly shown in the visual glossary, represented as 'id' in OpenAPI.

5. **Document and File relationship**: The visual glossary shows a more detailed relationship, while OpenAPI simplifies it.

6. **Error schema**: Present in OpenAPI but not represented in the visual glossary.

## Conclusion

Overall, there is a high degree of consistency between the visual glossary and the OpenAPI specification. The main structures and relationships are well-represented in both. However, there are some minor differences and additional details in the OpenAPI specification that are not captured in the visual glossary. These differences should be reconciled to ensure complete alignment between the conceptual model and the API implementation.
