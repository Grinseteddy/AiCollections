# OpenAPI Specification vs Visual Glossary Analysis

## Entities Present in Both

1. **Task**
   - OpenAPI: Defined as a schema with properties matching the glossary (id, description, status, assignee, creator, createdAt, lastUpdate, attachments)
   - Glossary: Central entity with correct relationships

2. **Inbox**
   - OpenAPI: Defined as a schema with id, name, and tasks
   - Glossary: Correctly shown as containing tasks

3. **TeamMember**
   - OpenAPI: Defined as a schema (used for assignee)
   - Glossary: Correctly linked to assignee

4. **Clerk**
   - OpenAPI: Defined as a schema (used for creator)
   - Glossary: Correctly linked to creator

5. **Attachment**
   - OpenAPI: Defined as a schema with reference to Document
   - Glossary: Correctly shown as part of Task

6. **Document**
   - OpenAPI: Defined as a schema containing Files
   - Glossary: Correctly shown in document management section

7. **File**
   - OpenAPI: Defined as a schema
   - Glossary: Correctly shown as part of Document

## Inconsistencies

1. **Note**
   - OpenAPI: Only NoteCreate schema is defined, not a full Note schema
   - Glossary: Shown as part of Task with Text, Author, and createdAt

2. **Status**
   - OpenAPI: Defined as an enum in Task schema (new, inProgress, done, declined)
   - Glossary: Shows an additional "not assigned" status

3. **Relationships**
   - OpenAPI: Does not explicitly define relationships between entities (relies on schema references)
   - Glossary: Clearly shows relationships like "contains," "references to"

## Missing in OpenAPI

1. Full Note schema (only NoteCreate is present)
2. Explicit relationships between entities
3. "not assigned" status for tasks

## Missing in Glossary

1. No representation of API endpoints or operations
2. No indication of required vs optional fields

## Overall Assessment

The OpenAPI specification is mostly valid based on the visual glossary, but there are some discrepancies and missing elements that should be addressed for full consistency.
