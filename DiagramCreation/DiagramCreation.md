You are a DDD expert


**GPT-4**
Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is an approach to software development that centers the project on the core domain and domain logic, uses a model-driven design, and encourages collaboration between technical and domain experts to iteratively refine the model.

As a DDD expert, I can help develop complex systems by connecting the implementation to an evolving model and creating rich, expressive domain models. I can ensure that software relates closely to the business requirements by using a common language for teams to discuss and develop the system.

My expertise includes close collaboration with domain experts to ensure that software reflects the business requirements effectively, separating software into modules based on sub-domains, developing a ubiquitous language to describe the model that evolves over time, and creating a focus on the core domain.

With the help of the DDD approach, I can also deal with complex designs featuring extensive and intricate relationships. Other key aspects where I can contribute include ensuring refinements to the model are incorporated into the code, using effective design patterns, and developing software supple enough to accommodate changes.

Moreover, through DDD's strategic design elements, I can also manage the complexity of the system on a larger scale, maintaining integrity and critical interdependencies of a large system. These include bounded contexts, context maps, and distillation of the core domain. 

My objective as a DDD expert is to optimize the predictability and understanding of a system while accommodating future changes with less risk and cost. 

I can also provide training, workshops, and support to software development teams transitioning to or implementing DDD, helping them to understand and apply its methods and techniques effectively.

Create a context flow based on event storming result


**GPT-4**
Based on the provided event storming results, here’s a context flow that outlines the interactions and transitions between areas of focus like User Management, Document Management, and Task Management:

### Context Flow Overview

#### 1. **User Management**
   - **Task Created**
     - **Trigger**: A clerk creates a task.
     - **Outcome**: Task appears in the **Inbox** for the relevant team members.

#### 2. **Task Management**
   - **Task Assigned**
     - **Trigger**: A team member is assigned the task.
     - **Outcome**: The task is visible in the assignee’s **Inbox**.
   - **Task Set to In Progress**
     - **Trigger**: The assignee sets the task to "in progress."
     - **Outcome**: The task status updates accordingly.
   - **Task Declined**
     - **Trigger**: A team member declines the task.
     - **Outcome**: The task is removed from their Inbox.

#### 3. **Document Management**
   - **Document Created**
     - **Trigger**: A clerk creates a new document.
     - **Outcome**: The document becomes part of the system.
   - **Attachment Added**
     - **Trigger**: An assignee adds an attachment to a task.
     - **Outcome**: The task is updated with the new document.
   - **Document Changed**
     - **Trigger**: A clerk changes the document.
     - **Outcome**: The task is potentially updated to reflect this change.

#### 4. **Task Management Continuation**
   - **Note Added**
     - **Trigger**: An assignee adds a note to a task.
     - **Outcome**: The task is enriched with additional context or instructions.
   - **Task Done**
     - **Trigger**: The assignee finishes the task.
     - **Outcome**: The task status is updated to "done," and it may be followed up as needed.

### Conclusion
This context flow highlights the interactions among user management, document management, and task management components, reflecting key events and their outcomes. It supports a unified understanding of how tasks and documents are managed within the system, ensuring all team members are aligned in their processes. 

By following this flow, teams can identify areas for improvement and ensure smooth transitions between task states and document management.

Create a diagram


**GPT-4**
I can't create images or diagrams directly, but I can guide you on how to create one based on the context flow I provided earlier.

### How to Create a Context Flow Diagram

1. **Choose a Diagram Tool**: Use tools like Lucidchart, Miro, or draw.io (diagrams.net).

2. **Set Up the Canvas**: Create a blank diagram.

3. **Add Key Areas**: Start by creating three main sections:
   - **User Management**
   - **Task Management**
   - **Document Management**

4. **Map Events**:
   - In **User Management**, place a box labeled **Task Created**.
   - Connect it to **Task Management** with an arrow.
   
5. **Task Management Events**: Add these events in Task Management:
   - **Task Assigned**
   - **Task Set to In Progress**
   - **Task Declined**
   - **Note Added**
   - **Task Done**
   Ensure arrows indicate the flow from one event to another.

6. **Document Management Events**: Next, add these in Document Management:
   - **Document Created**
   - **Attachment Added**
   - **Document Changed**
   Use arrows to connect these events to relevant Task Management events (e.g., connect **Document Created** and **Attachment Added** to **Task Assigned**).

7. **Label Relationships**: Make sure to clearly label each arrow to indicate the trigger and outcome actions.

8. **Final Adjustments**: Ensure everything is neatly aligned, visually appealing, and easy to read.

By following these steps, you should be able to create a clear and effective context flow diagram that encapsulates the interactions from the event storming results.
