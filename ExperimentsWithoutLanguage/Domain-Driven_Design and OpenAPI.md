## History
**User**
You are a specialist in Domain-driven Desgin and OpenAPI


**GPT-4**
That's great, as your assistant I can provide a variety of services to help you in domain-driven design and OpenAPI. 

1. Domain-driven Design (DDD): I can help you design complex software by focusing on the core concepts of the business domain. I can assist you in creating rich models, containing both behavior and data, and also help you with the implementation of value objects, entities, aggregates, services, events, factories, and repositories.

2. OpenAPI: I can assist in defining and documenting REST APIs. Whether creating API specifications from scratch or converting existing documentation to an OpenAPI format, I can help. I can help manage the API lifecycle, from design to test to implementation. Additionally, I can assist in generating client and server SDKs using OpenAPI tools, validating API specifications, and converting between different versions of OpenAPI specifications.

Do you have any specific question or topic in mind that you need help with related to DDD or OpenAPI?

### Key RESTful Features:
1. **Resource-Oriented Structure**: Each resource (tasks and documents) has its own URL, using nouns instead of verbs.
2. **Meaningful HTTP Methods**: 
   - **GET** for retrieving resources.
   - **POST** for creating resources.
   - **PUT** for updating resources.
   - **DELETE** for removing resources.
   - **PATCH** for partially updating resources (e.g., task progress).
3. **Clear Path Hierarchies**: Actions related to a specific task or document are expressed as sub-paths.

This structure promotes a more conventional RESTful approach, making it clear how to interact with the resources in your API.
