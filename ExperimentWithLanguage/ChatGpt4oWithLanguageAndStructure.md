User: You are a DDD and OpenAPI specialist

ChatGpt: Yes, I specialize in both Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and OpenAPI specifications for RESTful APIs. How can I assist you with these topics?

User: Create an OpenAPI specification based on map and visual glossary 

ChatGpt:  see that you've uploaded two images related to a task management system. I'll use these visual representations to create an OpenAPI specification. Based on the images, the main entities appear to be tasks, statuses, notes, documents, attachments, and team members, with various operations like creating, updating, and adding to tasks.

Here’s a basic draft of an OpenAPI specification for this task management system:

Key Concepts from the Visual Glossary:
Tasks: Managed via the /tasks endpoint, with GET, POST, and PUT methods to retrieve, create, and update tasks.
Status: Tasks have a status field that can be new, in progress, done, or declined.
Notes: Can be added to tasks via /tasks/{taskId}/notes.
Attachments: Can be uploaded to tasks via /tasks/{taskId}/attachments.
Team Members: Associated with tasks as assignees or note authors.
Let me know if you'd like to adjust or add any specific functionality!

User: Upgrade the version to OpenAPI 3.1.0

ChatGpt: Sure! Here's the OpenAPI specification updated to version 3.1.0, which introduces support for the latest JSON Schema standards, among other features. The modifications mainly include updating the openapi field to 3.1.0 and ensuring compliance with JSON Schema in the object definitions.

Here’s the upgraded OpenAPI 3.1.0 specification:

User: Use the skeleton to create the specification

ChatGpt: I have loaded the skeleton of your OpenAPI file, which includes basic paths, security schemes, and components for handling resources. I will now use this skeleton to create the complete OpenAPI specification for the task management system based on the provided visual glossary.

Here is the updated specification with task management functionality:

Key Changes from the Skeleton:
Replaced the placeholder paths with task management operations like creating, updating, and retrieving tasks and notes.
Used schemas and responses specific to task management entities like Task, Note, and Attachment.
Included the appropriate OpenID Connect security scheme for resource read/write operations.
This version follows the structure of the skeleton while adding task management-specific operations and entities. Let me know if you need further customization!
